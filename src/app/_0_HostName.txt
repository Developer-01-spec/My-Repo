CRUD  Operations in Angular:

C: Create   - Post

R: Read     - get

U: Update   - put

D: Delete   - Delete

All Possible API Calls:

Services :variable using get :Observable ---> Html: [(ngModel)] ="Variable" (keyup)= function() declaration   --->  in components: code for this  function()

Displaying All the data we use              get method()          get(url)
           
For Displaying Specific Data we use         get method()          get(url)

For filtering the specific Data we use      get method()         "url?filter" = keyword

For creating the pagination we use    get method()     (url)?limit=limitValue "&page" = pagenumber   

For sorting the data we use               get method()    "url?sortBy" = keyword "&order="asc/des

==========
For Creating the data we can use        post method()       post(url),data

For Update the data we can use          put method()        put(url/id),data

For Deleting the data we can use        delete method()     delete(url)/id


We can define a variable to an API to optimize the code.

baseUrl="www.google.com"

we can use baseUrl instead of www.google.com
